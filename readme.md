Successfully fine-tuned DeepSeek, LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma models using the QLoRA technique!

During this process, I deepened my understanding of:

LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation): Instead of updating full model weights, LoRA introduces two small trainable matrices A and B, such that the weight update is approximated by:


> ΔW = B @ A,
and the final adapted weight becomes W = W₀ + ΔW,
where W₀ is the original frozen weight.



This allows efficient and modular training while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.

QLoRA: It takes this a step further by combining LoRA with quantized models (e.g., 4-bit), allowing large models to be fine-tuned using limited GPU memory — all while retaining high performance. It enables training of billion-parameter models on consumer hardware.


I also explored how quantization works and how it enables storage and computation in lower precision (int4/int8), which dramatically reduces memory footprint and speeds up training.

These innovations are game changers for making fine-tuning large language models more accessible and scalable!
